## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where can I find a key to access the app?
You can find a key with public domain movies on our [website](http://watchitapp.site), or the community will be providing their own content soon.
If you want to generate your own content please visit the repository of our [gateway](https://github.com/ZorrillosDev/watchit-gateway).

### Is this illegal? What about copyright infringement?

Like many things, it depends on **`how you use it`**.

There is currently no mechanism to detect or prevent copyright infringement on the network. 
We are using public domain movies for our platform. 
However, there will never be a way to prevent someone from committing copyright infringement that wants to do so. 
That decision is finally left up to each person. Our goal is to limit infringement to only those who willfully want to commit it.

### What happens when I access the app?

You will replicate and maintain a copy of the metadata (not the videos or images only metadata requested), once somebody else connects to the network 
they are going to get a copy of the metadata from the nearest node.

### What happens when I sign out?

You will stop receiving any updates to  metadata will eventually be removed from your computer. 
If you log back in to the app you will acquire the metadata again like is the first time opening the app.

### What happens when I try to play a movie?


You will receive the stream data from somebody that is already watching the movie, 
or you will become the primary node sharing (`seeding`) the metadata of the movie, this will help you and other 
to download the stream faster while helping other.

### Will there be data on my computer that I have not asked for?

**Never**. You only get data that you request, and you will only keep data that you have chosen to stream.

### Can I find any movie I like?

To avoid copyright infringement you can only search for movies that are available for the public domain.
 We hope in the future we can work with partners to bring you a more up to date database of movie. so please be patience 
 this is just the begining.

*We are going to be updating this file to answer the most common questions also to explain a bit more about how to app works.*
